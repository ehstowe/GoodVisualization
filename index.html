<h1>What is a good visualization?</h1>
  <h2>First, here are two examples of bad visualizations.</h2>
  <p>On December 2, 2018, AL.com published an article titled "Alabama public school enrollment down, Hispanic 
    student population growing." The text of the article is overwhelmingly full of statistics. The article
    is a perfect occasion to display data visually... and the attempt to take advantage of this opportunity
    was feeble at best. The article contains these two tables which are as hard to understand as the statistic-filled
    article itself.<p>
