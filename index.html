  <h1><em>What is a good visualization?</em></h1>
<hr>
  <h2>First, here is an example of a bad visualization.</h2>
  <p>On December 2, 2018, AL.com published an article titled "Alabama public school enrollment down, Hispanic 
    student population growing." The text of the article is overwhelmingly full of statistics. The article
    is a perfect occasion to display data visually... and the attempt to take advantage of this opportunity
    was feeble at best. The article contains these two tables which are as hard to understand as the statistic-filled
    article itself.<p>

<p>This information could be better presented in a different way. For example, a slope chart could better indicate the
  speed at which different schools' populations changed over time. In <i>The Truthful Art</i>, Alberto Cairo dscribes five
  qualities of great visualizations. They are, according to Cairo, truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening.
  These tables are, to my knowledge, truthful, and are functional to some degree. They do their job - to depict data. However, they do
  not do this job well. They are not beautiful, insightful, or enlightening..</p>
  <p>The "island of knowledge" in these tables is small and in shallow waters. It is hard to determine a relationship between numbers. The
    reader is not encouraged to explore; they are more apt to skip over the tables.</p>

  <h2>Now, 
    <a href=
       "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/paths-to-congress.html">here</a> 
    is an example of a great visualization.</h2>
  <p>On January 26, 2019, <i>The New York Times</i> published an article titled "How Every Member Got
    to Congress," that included a powerful visualization tracking the "major educational, career,
    and political milestones" of the members of the House of Representatives.</p>
  <p>The visualization has a similar format to the visualization of the emergence of neuroscience 
    highlighted in Alberto Cairo's <i>The Truthful Art</i>. Though the information
    protrayed is complicated, it is made easy to understand because of the contrast of red and blue,
    the sections of thicker and thinner lines, and fact that it is interactive. The interaction
    between the user and the visualization encourages exploration - and it is powerful.</p>
  <p>The visualization changes when it is shrunk to a smaller screen - it transforms into several smaller,
    more specific segments of the original. This prevents the screen from becoming too cluttered and allows the user to 
    dive into the information presented more thoroughly.</p>
  <p>One important way in which the visualization expands upon the "island of knowledge" is that it presents material that is not
    easily attainable, in this compiled format, anywhere else. It is a unique compilation of data.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the visualization
    meets Cairo's five qualities of great visualizations - it is truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening.</p>
