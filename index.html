  <h1><em>What is a good visualization?</em></h1>
<hr>
  <h2>First, here are two examples of bad visualizations.</h2>
  <p>On December 2, 2018, AL.com published an article titled "Alabama public school enrollment down, Hispanic 
    student population growing." The text of the article is overwhelmingly full of statistics. The article
    is a perfect occasion to display data visually... and the attempt to take advantage of this opportunity
    was feeble at best. The article contains these two tables which are as hard to understand as the statistic-filled
    article itself.<p>
  <p>Read the entire article <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/12/alabama-public-school-enrollment-down-hispanic-student-population-growing.html">
    here.</a></p>

<p>This information could be better presented in a different way. For example, a slope chart could better indicate the
  speed at which different schools' populations changed over time.</p>

  <h2>Now, here is an example of a great visualization.</h2>
  <p>On January 26, 2019, <i>The New York Times</i> published an article titled "How Every Member Got
    to Congress," that included a powerful visualization tracking the "major educational, career,
    and political milestones" of the members of the House of Representatives. 
    Read the article <a href:"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/paths-to-congress.html">here.</a></p>
  <p>The visualization has a similar format to the visualization of the emergence of neuroscience 
    highlighted in Alberto Cairo's <i>The Truthful Art</i>. It seeks to enlighten and inform readers, not to 
    entertain or sell a product. It is easy to understand because of the contrast of red and blue,
    the sections of thicker and thinner lines, and the interactive feature that highlights each
    representative's track. The visualization changes when it is shrunk to a smaller screen - it transforms into several smaller,
    more specific segments of the original. This prevents the screen from becoming too cluttered. Ultimately, the visualization
    meets Cairo's five qualities of great visualizations - it is truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening.</p>
